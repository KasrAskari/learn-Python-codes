# Learn NumPy with Python  

## Overview  
This directory provides educational examples to learn and practice **NumPy**, Python’s powerful library for numerical computations. Designed for beginners and intermediate learners, it covers key features like array manipulation, mathematical operations, and matrix computations.

---

## Topics Covered  

### 1. **Getting Started with NumPy**  
- Installing NumPy: `pip install numpy`.  
- Importing and initializing arrays.  

### 2. **Array Basics**  
- Creating arrays using lists, ranges, and built-in functions (`arange`, `linspace`).  
- Reshaping, indexing, and slicing arrays.  

### 3. **Mathematical Functions**  
- Performing element-wise operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).  
- Using built-in functions (e.g., `np.sum`, `np.mean`, `np.sqrt`).  

### 4. **Matrix Operations**  
- Dot product and matrix multiplication.  
- Transpose, inverse, and determinants.  

### 5. **Statistical Functions**  
- Mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.  
- Working with datasets efficiently.
