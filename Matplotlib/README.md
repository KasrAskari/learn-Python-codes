## Overview
This repository contains foundational examples and codes for learning and experimenting with **Matplotlib**, a powerful plotting library for Python. These examples aim to help beginners understand how to visualize data effectively using various plots and charts.

## Features
- Simple examples of Matplotlib usage.
- Code for creating different types of plots such as:
  - Line plots
  - Scatter plots
  - Bar charts
  - Histograms
  - Pie charts
- Customizing plots (titles, labels, legends, colors, etc.).
- Introduction to subplots and figure adjustments.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
